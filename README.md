# Coursera GAN Specialization Exam Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for various exam problems from the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization on Coursera. In this repository, you will find different implementations of GANs built from scratch as part of the exam exercises in the course.

## üìú **Repository Overview**
This repository includes several projects where I implemented and solved different GAN-related problems using **PyTorch**. Each project focuses on specific aspects of GANs, such as:
- Building the **Generator** and **Discriminator** networks.
- Creating custom **loss functions**.
- Training the GANs on datasets and generating synthetic outputs.
- Visualizing the results of the generated images to monitor training progress.

### üìÇ **Projects**
Each subfolder corresponds to a specific exam problem and contains a `README.md` explaining the problem, the implementation approach, and how to run the code.

1. **[Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](./Build%20Basic%20Generative%20Adversarial%20Networks%20%28GANs%29)**  
  


## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework used to implement all GAN models.
- **Python**: Programming language for coding the solutions.


## üöÄ **How to Use This Repository**
1.  Clone the Repository:
    - You can receive codes with:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/easyCoder-Ai/GAN.git
        cd <each project on this repository>

2. Install Dependencies:
    - Make sure you have PyTorch and other necessary libraries installed:
    
            pip install -r requirements.txt -e <your current environment>

3.  Run 

    - You can run the code with:

        ```bash
        python3 main.py


## üìñ **Learning Objectives**
Through these exam problems, I worked on several key learning objectives, including:

Designing and implementing GANs from scratch.
Using GANs for data generation tasks.
Fine-tuning models to generate high-quality synthetic data.
Visualizing the progression of GAN training.
