    Function for creating noise vectors: Given the dimensions (n_samples, z_dim),
    creates a tensor of that shape filled with random numbers from the normal distribution.
    Parameters:
        n_samples: the number of samples to generate, a scalar
        z_dim: the dimension of the noise vector, a scalar
        device: the device type
