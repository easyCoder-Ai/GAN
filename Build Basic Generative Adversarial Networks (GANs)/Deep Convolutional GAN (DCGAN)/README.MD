# Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) for MNIST Handwritten Digits
This repository contains my Coursera GAN specialization project, where I implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

üìú Project Overview
The objective of this project is to implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), a well-known and widely used type of GAN. The DCGAN architecture leverages convolutional layers to generate high-quality, realistic handwritten digit images. This project serves as a hands-on exercise in building and training GANs, particularly DCGANs, from scratch.

# Specifically, the project focuses on:

 - Building the Generator and Discriminator networks using deep convolutional layers.
 - Defining the loss functions (binary cross-entropy) required to train the GAN.
 - Training the GAN with the MNIST dataset and generating realistic handwritten digits.
 - Visualizing the generated images during the training process.

üìö Learning Objectives
- Constructing DCGAN Components: Implementing the Generator and Discriminator networks using convolutional layers.
- Loss Function Implementation: Applying the appropriate loss functions (generator loss, discriminator loss) and optimizers for effective training.
- Training a DCGAN: Training the model on the MNIST dataset and learning to generate convincing digit images.
- Visualizing Generated Images: Tracking the training progress by visualizing the synthetic digits generated by the GAN.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- PyTorch: The primary deep learning framework used for building and training the DCGAN.
- Python: The programming language used throughout the project.
- Torchvision: For easy access to the MNIST dataset.
- Matplotlib: To visualize training progress and generated images.

üöÄ How to Run the Code
1.  Clone the Repository:
    '
    git clone https://github.com/easyCoder-Ai/GAN.git
    cd Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
    '

2. Install Dependencies:
    - Make sure you have PyTorch and other necessary libraries installed:
    
            pip install -r requirements.txt -e <your current environment>

3.  Run 

    python3 main.py


üìä Results
Throughout the training process, images of the generated digits are visualized to track the GAN‚Äôs progress. The DCGAN learns to produce synthetic handwritten digits that closely resemble the real ones. The quality of these generated digits improves with more epochs of training.


üí° Key Takeaways
- The DCGAN effectively leverages convolutional layers to generate high-resolution images compared to traditional GANs.
- The model‚Äôs ability to generate realistic images of handwritten digits improves with more training epochs.
- Hands-on implementation of GANs is an effective way to gain a deeper understanding of adversarial learning and deep learning.
