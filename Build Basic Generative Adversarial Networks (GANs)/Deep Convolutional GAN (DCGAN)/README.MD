# Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) for MNIST Handwritten Digits
This repository contains my Coursera GAN specialization project, where I implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

## 📜 **Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), a well-known and widely used type of GAN. The DCGAN architecture leverages convolutional layers to generate high-quality, realistic handwritten digit images. This project serves as a hands-on exercise in building and training GANs, particularly DCGANs, from scratch.

## Specifically, the project focuses on:

 - Building the Generator and Discriminator networks using deep convolutional layers.
 - Defining the loss functions (binary cross-entropy) required to train the GAN.
 - Training the GAN with the MNIST dataset and generating realistic handwritten digits.
 - Visualizing the generated images during the training process.

## 📚 **Learning Objectives**
- Constructing DCGAN Components: Implementing the Generator and Discriminator networks using convolutional layers.
- Loss Function Implementation: Applying the appropriate loss functions (generator loss, discriminator loss) and optimizers for effective training.
- Training a DCGAN: Training the model on the MNIST dataset and learning to generate convincing digit images.
- Visualizing Generated Images: Tracking the training progress by visualizing the synthetic digits generated by the GAN.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- PyTorch: The primary deep learning framework used for building and training the DCGAN.
- Python: The programming language used throughout the project.
- Torchvision: For easy access to the MNIST dataset.
- Matplotlib: To visualize training progress and generated images.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Code**
1.  Clone the Repository:
    - You can receive codes with:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/easyCoder-Ai/GAN.git
        cd Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)/Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)

2. Install Dependencies:
    - Make sure you have PyTorch and other necessary libraries installed:
    
            pip install -r requirements.txt -e <your current environment>

3.  Run 

    - You can run the code with:

        ```bash
        python3 main.py


## 📊 **Results**
Throughout the training process, images of the generated digits are visualized to track the GAN’s progress. The DCGAN learns to produce synthetic handwritten digits that closely resemble the real ones. The quality of these generated digits improves with more epochs of training.


## 💡 **Key Takeaways**
- The DCGAN effectively leverages convolutional layers to generate high-resolution images compared to traditional GANs.
- The model’s ability to generate realistic images of handwritten digits improves with more training epochs.
- Hands-on implementation of GANs is an effective way to gain a deeper understanding of adversarial learning and deep learning.


## 📊 **Results**
As the training progresses, the Conditional GAN will generate images of digits conditioned on the input class. The images are visualized at different stages to observe how the quality and accuracy of the generated digits improve over time. The generator becomes better at producing digits that match the specified class while maintaining variety due to the noise vector.

## 💡 **Key Takeaways**
- Conditioning Enhances Control: By conditioning the GAN on a specific class, you gain control over the output, allowing you to generate specific types of images on demand.
- Vector Interplay: The class vector determines the digit to be generated, while the noise vector adds variability, resulting in diverse but class-specific images.
- GAN Flexibility: The principles learned here can be applied to generate other types of conditioned images, such as animals or faces, by adjusting the input data.
