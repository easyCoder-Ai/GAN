def get_input_dimensions(z_dim, mnist_shape, n_classes):
    '''
    Function for getting the size of the conditional input dimensions 
    from z_dim, the image shape, and number of classes.
    Parameters:
        z_dim: the dimension of the noise vector, a scalar
        mnist_shape: the shape of each MNIST image as (C, W, H), which is (1, 28, 28)
        n_classes: the total number of classes in the dataset, an integer scalar
                (10 for MNIST)
    Returns: 
        generator_input_dim: the input dimensionality of the conditional generator, 
                          which takes the noise and class vectors
        discriminator_im_chan: the number of input channels to the discriminator
                            (e.g. C x 28 x 28 for MNIST)
