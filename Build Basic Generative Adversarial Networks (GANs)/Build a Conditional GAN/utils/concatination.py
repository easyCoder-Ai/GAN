def combine_vectors(x, y):
    '''
    Function for combining two vectors with shapes (n_samples, ?) and (n_samples, ?).
    Parameters:
      x: (n_samples, ?) the first vector. 
        In this assignment, this will be the noise vector of shape (n_samples, z_dim), 
        but you shouldn't need to know the second dimension's size.
      y: (n_samples, ?) the second vector.
        Once again, in this assignment this will be the one-hot class vector 
        with the shape (n_samples, n_classes), but you shouldn't assume this in your code.
