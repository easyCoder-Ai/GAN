### Spectrally Normalized Generative Adversarial Networks (SN-GAN)
This repository contains an implementation of Spectrally Normalized Generative Adversarial Networks (SN-GAN), a type of GAN designed to stabilize the training of the discriminator by applying spectral normalization to its weight matrices. The implementation is based on the paper "Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks" by Miyato et al. (2018).

## üìú **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to implement SN-GAN and understand how spectral normalization can improve the stability and performance of GANs. Spectral normalization controls the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator by normalizing its weight matrices, which helps in preventing issues like vanishing gradients and mode collapse during training.

## Specifically, this project focuses on:
- Implementing spectral normalization for the discriminator's weight matrices.
- Constructing and training the SN-GAN architecture.
- Comparing the performance and stability of SN-GAN with standard GANs.
- Visualizing the generated images and understanding the impact of spectral normalization on training dynamics.

## üìö **Learning Objectives**
- Understanding Spectral Normalization: Learn the theoretical foundations of spectral normalization and its importance in GAN training.
- Implementing SN-GAN Components: Build the Generator and Discriminator networks with spectral normalization applied to the discriminator.
- Training and Evaluation: Train the SN-GAN on a chosen dataset and evaluate its performance compared to a traditional GAN.
- Visualization and Analysis: Visualize the training process, generated images, and analyze the impact of spectral normalization on the GAN's stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- PyTorch: The primary deep learning framework used for building and training the SN-GAN.
- Python: The programming language used throughout the project.
- Torchvision: Used for dataset loading and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing training progress and generated images.
