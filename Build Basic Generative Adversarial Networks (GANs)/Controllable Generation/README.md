# Controllable GAN Generation Using Classifier Gradients
This repository contains a project focused on implementing a controllable generation technique using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The method allows for the manipulation of generated images by adjusting the generator's input vectors (z-vectors) based on gradients from a pre-trained classifier.

## üìú **Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to explore controllable image generation by leveraging a pre-trained GAN and classifier. By utilizing gradients from the classifier, the generator's input can be adjusted to emphasize or de-emphasize specific features in the generated images. This project primarily focuses on manipulating images from the CelebA dataset, a large-scale dataset of celebrity images with various annotations.

## Specifically, the project focuses on:
- Controllability Method Implementation: Using classifier gradients to modify the generator‚Äôs input vectors to control the features in the generated images.
- Pre-trained Model Utilization: Working with a pre-trained generator and classifier to emphasize the controllability aspects without the need to train these models from scratch.
- Feature Manipulation: Observing the effects of feature manipulation on generated images and addressing challenges posed by entangled features.
- Dataset: Utilizing the CelebA dataset for generating and manipulating high-quality, colored images.
