# InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing GAN
This repository contains my exploration and implementation of InfoGAN, a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that focuses on generating disentangled and interpretable outputs. The InfoGAN architecture builds upon the traditional GAN model by introducing a latent code that enables more interpretable and meaningful variations in the generated data. This project is inspired by the research paper InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets by Chen et al.

## üìú **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to understand and implement the InfoGAN model, which allows for the generation of images with interpretable variations by maximizing mutual information between a subset of the latent variables and the generated data. InfoGAN achieves this by separating the noise vector into two parts: one part that remains purely random and another part, known as the latent code, that is designed to capture interpretable features.

## Specifically the project focuses on:
- Understanding the architecture and theoretical underpinnings of InfoGAN.
- Implementing the InfoGAN model, including the generator and discriminator networks.
- Introducing a latent code into the GAN framework to produce interpretable outputs.
- Maximizing mutual information between the latent code and the generated images to ensure the latent code corresponds to meaningful variations in the data.
- Running and analyzing the model on different datasets to observe the disentangled features learned by the InfoGAN.

## üìö **Learning Objectives**
- Interpretable GAN Outputs: Gain an understanding of how InfoGAN can be used to generate images with interpretable variations, making it possible to control specific aspects of the generated data.
- Mutual Information in GANs: Learn about the concept of mutual information and how it can be applied within the GAN framework to enhance interpretability.
- Advanced GAN Architectures: Explore the differences between traditional GANs and InfoGAN, focusing on the additional components and objectives introduced by InfoGAN.
- Practical Implementation: Implement and experiment with the InfoGAN model to gain hands-on experience in working with advanced GAN architectures.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework used for building and training the InfoGAN model.
- Python: The programming language used throughout the project.
- NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries used for visualizing the results and analyzing the interpretability of the generated outputs.

## üìä **Results**
As the model trains, the InfoGAN successfully generates images where specific aspects of the output can be controlled by adjusting the latent code. This demonstrates the effectiveness of mutual information maximization in producing interpretable and disentangled representations in the generated data.
